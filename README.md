# shoelace-design-kit
A Figma design kit for the Shoelace Design System.

This repository is largely used to track the issues for creating a design kit in Figma. At the moment there aren't really any "source" files in here.

The project that shows the current work progress is [here](https://github.com/users/nateclicks/projects/1)

You can find the current library in the Figma Community at [Shoelace UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1313562572587785159/in-progress-shoelace-ui-kit)
