# shoelace-design-kit
A Figma design kit for the Shoelace Design System.

This repository is largely used to track the issues for creating a design kit in Figma. At the moment there isn't really any "source" files in here.

The project that shows the current work progress is [here](https://github.com/users/nateclicks/projects/1)
